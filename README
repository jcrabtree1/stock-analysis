This is a project to test some stock analysis techniques using both Python
and R.  We will begin by creating a simple script to collect curren stock quote
data and write it to a file.

collect-data.py:
    Used to collect data on a single stock every two minutes while the markets are open (9:30am - 4:00pm).
    Set a scheduled task to start this at 9:30am and let it run until 4:00pm
